## Javascript Solution

```Javascript
var largestAltitude = function(gain) {
  let prev=0;
  let max=0;
  gain.forEach((ele)=>{
    let val=prev+ele;
    max=Math.max(max,val);
    prev=val;
  })
  return max;
};
```

Approach: Prefix Sum
</summary>

## Intuition

We start from the altitude 0 and we have a list of NNN integers, where each integer represents the gain in altitude at each step 
(it could be negative as well, which implies a fall in altitude) a biker takes. We need to return the highest altitude of the biker 
in the complete journey, including the starting point at 0.

This can be solved by taking the maximum altitudes at each step in the journey. The altitude at a step can be determined as the 
altitude at the previous step plus the gain at the current step. Hence, we will start from 0 and keep adding the gain in altitude 
to it at each step, and after each addition, we will update the maximum altitude we have seen so far.

### Implementation 
  
```Java
class Solution {
  public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
    int currentAltitude = 0;
    // Highest altitude currently is 0.
    int highestPoint = currentAltitude;
  
    for (int altitudeGain : gain) {
      // Adding the gain in altitude to the current altitude.
      currentAltitude += altitudeGain;
      // Update the highest altitude.
      highestPoint = Math.max(highestPoint, currentAltitude);
    }

    return highestPoint;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
  
Here, $N$ is the number of integers in the list gain.
### Time complexity: $O(N)$.
We iterate over every integer in the list gain only once, and hence the total time complexity is equal to $O(N)$.
### Space complexity: $O(1)$.
We only need two variables, currentAltitude andhighestPoint; hence the space complexity is constant.
